# **Assignment6: Layout Principles**
This document demonstrates the F-Layout, Z-Layout, and Card-Layout principles citing specific examples.
According to the Gutenberg diagram, there are four quadrants to a page that follows the natural eye movements of a person. (i.e. reading gravity)
Beginning with the primary optical area at the top left followed by the strong follow area at the top-right, a weak follow area at the bottom left, and finally the terminal area/call to action. 
## F-Layout
**Example Webpage**: https://www.bloomberg.com/
The F-Layout works best for content heavy webpages.  Several eye tracking experiments have shown that people tend to follow an F shaped pattern while viewing webpages.  Therefore, placing content along this F pattern will capture the reader's interest.  The most important content should go to the primary optical area from top left and across - in this case, the Bloomberg logo and links to various types of articles/content.  This is then followed by the second strong follow area at the next section of the 'F' - the main headline and an image to go with it.  The pattern continues with several paragraphs each having just one news item.  There is content placed to break the monotony to retain the reader's interest such as the article on IRS delays.  There are side bars for latest news and opinion and there is a strategically placed secondary call to action advertising St. Patrick's Day Celebrations.  
## Z-Layout
**Example Webpage**: https://www.gap.com/
The Z-layout works best for simpler content with one purpose, a call to action.  Here, viewer's eye movements follow a z pattern starting with the top left as the primary optical area, then moves across to the top right as the second strong follow area.  The main content is typically an image or a carousel of images that is meant to lead the viewer to the final bottom right where there is a call to action.  The background is kept simple and the page typically showcases the brand, has good organizational structure, tells a good story and has a strong call to action.  

In this example, The Gap brand is in the primary optical area, followed by the search button at the strong follow area at the top right.  Then the carousel of images of "individuals" showcases some of Gap's products, but guides the shopper to the call to action to shop gap products which is the primary intent of the website.

The Z-Layout is a observed in the first part of the gap.com website with some further content if you scroll past. 
## Card-Layout
**Example Webpage**: https://eatfresh.org/find-a-recipe
The Card-Layout does not follow the Gutenberg diagram but has many advantages. It is very responsive and mobile friendly, can easily reposition and resize based on the type of view port. The content is rank free and easy to read and browse.It is universal and works for a wide variety of content. eCommerce and recipes to name a few. More and more websites are adopting the card pattern over F-Layouts. 
Our example, you can see how easy it is to resize and reorganize the layout for a laptop view-port which has a 4x4 card layout vs your mobile phone view-port with just a one card sequence. The card layout works well for the recipes which are rank free.
